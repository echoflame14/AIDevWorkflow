Here are my recommendations for improvement:

Modularity and Code Organization:


Consider extracting common utilities (file handling, hashing, API interactions) into a shared utils module
Create a proper TypeScript module structure with clear exports instead of standalone scripts
Implement a proper error handling system with custom error types


Configuration Management:


Replace the current configuration scattered across files with a centralized config management
Add support for different environment configurations (dev, prod, etc.)
Consider using a configuration validation library to ensure config correctness


Performance Optimizations:


Implement parallel processing for file operations, especially in the RAG system
Add streaming support for large file processing
Implement batch processing for API calls to reduce rate limiting issues
