The project also depends on \"clipboardy\" for clipboard management and \"dotenv\" for environment variable handling.   </dependencies>   <unique_characteristics>     This package.json file showcases a Node.js project that utilizes TypeScript, with several custom scripts for managing different aspects of the application workflow, such as \"structure\", \"capture\", \"diff\", and \"rag\". The project likely has specialized functionality related to AI and code analysis.   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     The package.json file does not directly define any methods, as it is a configuration file. However, it references several script commands that may correspond to methods or functions in the project's codebase, such as \"getStructure\", \"captureCodebase\", \"diff\", and \"rag\".   </methods>   <exports if any>     The package.json file does not define any exports, as it is a configuration file and not a module.   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     The package.json file provides a high-level overview of the project's structure and dependencies, indicating that it is a TypeScript-based Node.js application focused on AI workflows and code analysis. The presence of custom scripts suggests that the project may have specialized functionality beyond a typical Node.js application.   </any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know> </summary>",
