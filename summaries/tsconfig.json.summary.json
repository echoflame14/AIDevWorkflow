It specifies the target ECMAScript version, module system, output directory, and other compilation options.</purpose>   <key_components>     \"compilerOptions\": This object contains the primary configuration settings for the TypeScript compiler, including:     - \"target\": The ECMAScript version to compile to (e.g., ES2020)     - \"module\": The module system to use (e.g., CommonJS)     - \"outDir\": The output directory for the compiled JavaScript files     - \"rootDir\": The root directory for the TypeScript source files     - \"strict\": Enables strict type-checking     - \"esModuleInterop\": Enables interoperability between ECMAScript modules and CommonJS modules     - \"skipLibCheck\": Skips type checking of declaration files     \"include\": An array of file patterns to include in the compilation     \"exclude\": An array of file patterns to exclude from the compilation   </key_components>   <dependencies>The tsconfig.json file is self-contained and does not have any external dependencies. However, it is typically used in conjunction with the TypeScript compiler (tsc) and other TypeScript-related tooling.</dependencies>   <unique_characteristics>The tsconfig.json file is a standard configuration file for TypeScript projects and is widely used across the TypeScript ecosystem. It provides a centralized and standardized way to control the compilation of TypeScript code.</unique_characteristics>   <methods>The tsconfig.json file does not contain any methods, as it is a configuration file rather than a programming file.</methods>   <exports if any>The tsconfig.json file does not export any values, as it is a configuration file rather than a programming file.</exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>   The tsconfig.json file is an important part of any TypeScript project, as it allows developers to customize the compilation process and ensure that the TypeScript code is compiled correctly. It is typically checked into version control along with the rest of the project files.   </any other information...> </summary>",
