  "summary": "This JSON file is a configuration file for the TypeScript compiler, commonly known as the `tsconfig.json` file. Its main purpose is to define the settings and options for compiling TypeScript code into JavaScript. The key points of this configuration are: 1. **Compiler Options**:    - `target`: Sets the ECMAScript target version to ES2020.    - `module`: Specifies the module system to be used, in this case, CommonJS.    - `outDir`: Defines the output directory for the compiled JavaScript files, which is `./dist`.    - `rootDir`: Specifies the root directory for the TypeScript source files, which is `./src`.    - `strict`: Enables strict type-checking, ensuring better code quality and maintainability.    - `esModuleInterop`: Allows interoperability between ECMAScript modules and CommonJS modules.    - `skipLibCheck`: Skips type-checking of declaration files (`.d.ts`), which can improve compilation speed. 2. **Include and Exclude**:    - `include`: Specifies that all TypeScript files in the `src` directory and its subdirectories should be included in the compilation.    - `exclude`: Excludes the `node_modules` directory from the compilation, as it typically contains third-party dependencies that don't need to be compiled. This `tsconfig.json` file sets up the necessary configuration for compiling a TypeScript-based project, ensuring that the TypeScript code is compiled to JavaScript with the desired target environment, module system, and other important settings.",
