These areas are commonly encountered in the development of complex, data-intensive systems like a RAG system.   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     The file does not contain any code or method definitions, so there are no specific methods to list.   </methods>   <exports if any>     The file does not contain any exports, as it is a set of recommendations rather than a code file.   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     The recommendations in this file are aimed at improving the overall maintainability, scalability, and performance of the RAG system. Implementing these recommendations would likely require changes to multiple parts of the codebase and may involve refactoring or architectural changes. It's important to consider the impact of these changes on the system's functionality and existing workflows.   </any other information...> </summary>",
