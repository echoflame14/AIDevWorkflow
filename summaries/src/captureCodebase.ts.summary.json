  "summary": "<summary>   <purpose>The primary purpose of this code is to capture the structure and content of a codebase based on specified inclusion patterns, and generate a text output file containing the captured data.</purpose>   <key_components>     The main class in this code is `CodebaseCapture`, which is responsible for loading inclusion patterns, scanning a directory, and formatting the output. The key exports are:     - `CodebaseCapture` class     - `captureCodebase` function   </key_components>   <dependencies>     The code depends on the following npm packages:     - `fs`: For file system operations     The code also depends on several utility classes and functions imported from the `./utils` module.   </dependencies>   <unique_characteristics>     The unique characteristics of this code include:     - Ability to load inclusion patterns from a CSV file     - Recursive directory scanning with support for various file patterns (simple and regex)     - Capturing and preserving file contents in the output     - Formatting the output as a text file with a clear structure   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     - `loadPatterns()`: Loads inclusion patterns from a file     - `formatOutput(node, result = [])`: Formats the directory/file tree into a text output     - `capture(rootDir)`: Main method to execute the codebase capture process   </methods>   <exports if any>     - `captureCodebase(rootDir, patternsPath?)`: A function that instantiates and executes the `CodebaseCapture` class   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     This code is likely part of a larger system that requires capturing and processing the structure and content of a codebase. The captured output can be used for various purposes, such as:     - Indexing the codebase for search and retrieval     - Generating documentation or visualizations     - Performing static code analysis or other automated tasks     The ability to customize the inclusion patterns and handle file system errors are important features that contribute to the robustness and flexibility of this code.   </any other information...> </summary>",
