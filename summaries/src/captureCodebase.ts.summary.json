  "summary": "This TypeScript file contains the implementation of a `CodebaseCapture` class, which is designed to capture the structure and content of a codebase based on inclusion patterns. The main purpose of this class is to provide a way to generate a snapshot of a codebase that can be used for various purposes, such as code analysis, backup, or sharing. The key functionality of the `CodebaseCapture` class includes: 1. **Loading Include Patterns**: The class can load inclusion patterns from a CSV file. These patterns define which files and directories should be captured. If no patterns are provided, the class will include all files except for those matching the default ignore patterns. 2. **Scanning Directory Structure**: The `scanDirectory` method recursively scans the specified root directory and constructs a `DirectoryStructure` object, which represents the directory structure and the files within it. 3. **File Content Capture**: The class reads the content of each included file and stores it in the `DirectoryStructure` object. 4. **Output Formatting**: The `formatOutput` method takes the `DirectoryStructure` object and formats it into a string output, where each file's content is separated by a header. 5. **Execution and Output**: The class provides a `capture` method that can be called to execute the codebase capture process. The output is then saved to a `paste.txt` file in the same directory. The class also includes support for command-line execution, allowing users to specify the root directory and the path to the CSV file containing the inclusion patterns. Overall, this `CodebaseCapture` class provides a convenient way to create a snapshot of a codebase, which can be useful for various software development and maintenance tasks.",
