  "summary": "<summary> <purpose>The primary purpose of this script is to provide a utility for capturing and generating commit scripts from Git diffs. It allows users to compare the current state of the working directory against a specified Git reference (e.g., HEAD, a commit hash, or a branch) and generate a ready-to-use commit command with the diff output.</purpose> <key_components> - `DiffCapturer` class: Responsible for executing the Git diff command, logging debug messages, and generating the commit script file. - `captureDiff()` method: The main public method that generates the commit script file based on the provided Git reference. - `executeGitDiff()` method: A private method that executes the Git diff command with specific arguments and returns the raw diff output. - Command-line interface handling: Allows users to run the script from the command line and pass optional arguments (Git reference and verbose mode). </key_components> <dependencies> - `child_process` module: Used to execute the Git diff command. - `fs` module: Used to write the generated commit script file to the file system. </dependencies> <unique_characteristics> - Provides a user-friendly interface for generating commit scripts with a pre-formatted commit template. - Includes options for ignoring space changes and blank lines in the diff output. - Supports generating diffs against a specific Git reference (e.g., HEAD, commit hash, branch). - Includes a command-line interface for easy usage. </unique_characteristics> <methods> - `private log(message: string)`: Logs debug messages if verbose mode is enabled. - `private executeGitDiff(target?: string)`: Executes the Git diff command with specified arguments and returns the raw diff output. - `public captureDiff(target?: string)`: Generates a commit script file containing the diff output and a commit template. </methods> <exports if any> None (this is a standalone script). </exports if any> <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know> This script is a standalone utility and does not have any additional dependencies or configuration requirements beyond the built-in Node.js modules it uses. It is designed to be a self-contained tool for generating commit scripts from Git diffs. </any other information...> </summary>",
