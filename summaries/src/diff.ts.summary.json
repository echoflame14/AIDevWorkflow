  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a utility class called `DiffCapturer` that can capture git diffs and generate a commit script file. Here are the key functionalities: 1. **Capturing Git Diffs**: The `DiffCapturer` class has a `captureDiff` method that executes the `git diff` command with specific parameters (e.g., `--staged`, `--ignore-space-change`, `--ignore-blank-lines`) and retrieves the raw diff output. 2. **Generating Commit Script File**: The `captureDiff` method then generates a commit script file named `paste.txt` in the current directory. The script file contains a commit template with the diff output and instructions for the user to follow when creating a commit. 3. **Verbose Logging**: The `DiffCapturer` class has a `verbose` option that, when enabled, logs debug messages during the execution of the `git diff` command. 4. **Command-line Interface**: The file also includes a command-line interface (CLI) handling section that allows users to run the `DiffCapturer` class directly from the terminal. Users can provide an optional Git reference (e.g., commit hash or tag) to compare against, as well as enable verbose mode. In summary, the main purpose of this utility is to simplify the process of generating commit scripts for developers, making it easier to create semantic and well-structured commit messages.",
