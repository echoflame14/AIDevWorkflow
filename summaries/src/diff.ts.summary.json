  "summary": "<summary> <purpose>The primary purpose of this module is to provide a utility class called `DiffCapturer` that can execute the `git diff` command and generate a commit script file containing the diff output and a commit template.</purpose> <key_components> - The `GitError` class represents errors that occur during Git operations. - The `DiffCapturer` class is responsible for capturing git diffs and generating commit script files.   - It has a private `outputFile` property that holds the path to the output file.   - The `executeGitDiff` method executes the `git diff` command with specified arguments and returns the output.   - The `captureDiff` method generates the commit script file by combining the diff output, a commit prompt, and a header/footer. - The command-line interface handling at the end of the file allows running the `DiffCapturer` from the command line. </key_components> <dependencies> - `child_process` module from Node.js for executing Git commands - `./utils/errors/customErrors` module for custom error classes (`AppError`, `FileSystemError`) - `./utils/errors/errorHandler` module for handling errors - `./utils/fs/fileReader` module for writing the output file - `./utils/fs/pathUtils` module for normalizing file paths </dependencies> <unique_characteristics> - The `DiffCapturer` class uses the `spawnSync` function from the `child_process` module to execute the `git diff` command and capture its output. - The generated commit script file includes a commit prompt and a header/footer to provide a user-friendly way to review and apply the changes. - The class has a `verbose` option to enable debug logging. - The `GitError` class is a custom error type that provides additional information about Git command failures. </unique_characteristics> <methods> - `constructor(outputPath: string = 'paste.txt', private verbose: boolean = false)` - `private log(message: string): void` - `private executeGitDiff(target?: string): string` - `public captureDiff(target?: string): void` </methods> <exports if any> - `GitError` class - `DiffCapturer` class </exports if any> <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know> This module is likely part of a larger codebase that provides Git-related utilities and functionality. The `DiffCapturer` class and `GitError` class could be used in other parts of the application to handle Git operations and capture diffs. The command-line interface allows users to run the `DiffCapturer` directly from the terminal, which can be useful for quickly generating commit scripts. </any other information...> </summary>",
