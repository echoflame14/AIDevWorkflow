  "summary": "The main purpose of this TypeScript file is to provide a utility class called `DiffCapturer` that captures the git diff of the current or a specified commit and generates a formatted output file. The key functionality of this class includes: 1. **Executing Git Diff**: The `executeGitDiff` method runs the `git diff` command with the specified target (default is `HEAD`) and captures the output. 2. **Formatting Diff Output**: The `captureDiff` method generates a formatted output file named `paste.txt`. The file contains a header with the current timestamp, the git diff command, and a bash script that can be used to generate a commit message based on the changes. 3. **Verbose Logging**: The class has an optional `verbose` mode that logs additional debugging information. The file also includes a main entry point that allows running the `DiffCapturer` class from the command line, accepting an optional target commit as an argument and the `--verbose` flag. The primary use case for this utility is to streamline the process of generating a commit message based on the current or specified git diff, making it easier for developers to create well-structured and informative commit messages.",
