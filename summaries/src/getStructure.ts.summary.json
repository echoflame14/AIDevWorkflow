  "summary": "This TypeScript file is a utility that scans a directory structure and generates an instructional prompt for efficiently requesting file summaries and full file contents. The main functionality of this code is as follows: 1. **Directory Structure Scanning**: The `StructureScanner` class scans a given directory (and its subdirectories) and creates a `DirectoryNode` object that represents the directory structure. This includes files, their token counts, and the relative paths of the files and directories. 2. **Formatting the Directory Structure**: The `formatTree` method takes the `DirectoryNode` structure and formats it as a string, with a hierarchical representation of the directory structure and file information. 3. **Generating an Instructional Prompt**: The `generateInstructionPrompt` method takes the formatted directory structure and generates a comprehensive instructional prompt. This prompt includes guidelines for how to efficiently request file summaries and full file contents, using a CSV format. 4. **Executable Script**: The code at the bottom of the file runs the `StructureScanner` and generates the instructional prompt. It then writes the prompt to a file named \"paste.txt\" and (if possible) copies the prompt to the system clipboard. The main purpose of this code is to provide a tool that can help users quickly understand the structure of a codebase and efficiently request relevant file information (summaries and full contents) from the developer, without needing to review the entire codebase. This can be particularly useful in collaborative scenarios or when working with unfamiliar code.",
