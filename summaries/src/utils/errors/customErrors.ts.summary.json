This can improve error handling and debugging in the application.   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     - AppError: constructor     - FileSystemError: constructor     - PatternError: constructor     - FileReadError: constructor     - DirectoryError: constructor   </methods>   <exports if any>     - AppError     - FileSystemError     - PatternError     - FileReadError     - DirectoryError   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     The custom error classes defined in this file are likely used throughout the application to handle various types of errors, providing a consistent and informative way to handle and report issues.   </any other information...> </summary>",
