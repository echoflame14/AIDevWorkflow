It abstracts the complexity of pattern matching and provides a consistent API for testing file paths against these patterns.   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     - `globToRegex()`     - `matchGlobPattern()`     - `matchRegexPattern()`     - `matchPattern()`     - `matchAnyPattern()`     - `createPattern()`     - `parsePatternInput()`   </methods>   <exports if any>     - `PatternMatcher` class   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     The `PatternMatcher` class is a key utility in the broader project, as it enables flexible file filtering and selection based on various pattern types. It is likely used throughout the codebase to handle file-related operations and configurations.   </any other information...> </summary>",
