The scripts provide functionality for capturing codebase snapshots, generating Git diffs, analyzing directory structures, and generating AI-powered file summaries.</purpose>   <key_components>     - captureCodebase.ts: Captures a snapshot of the codebase while respecting include/exclude patterns.     - diff.ts: Generates Git diffs for code review and documentation.     - getStructure.ts: Creates a directory structure map with file token counts.     - rag.ts: Generates AI-powered file summaries using the Claude 3 Haiku model.   </key_components>   <dependencies>     - The scripts require Node.js and npm to be installed.     - An Anthropic API key is needed for the rag.ts script to function.   </dependencies>   <unique_characteristics>     - Configurable file inclusion/exclusion patterns.     - Caching and metadata tracking for AI-generated file summaries.     - Comprehensive error handling for file system and API operations.   </unique_characteristics>   <methods>     - captureCodebase: captureCodebase(directory, patternsFile)     - diff: diff(commitOrBranch)     - getStructure: getStructure()     - rag: rag(fileExtensions)   </methods>   <exports if any>     The scripts do not export any modules or functions. They are intended to be run as standalone utilities.   </exports if any>   <any other information that you think an llm looking at a summary of all files in the repo would need to know>     The scripts generate output files in the 'paste.txt' and 'summaries/' directories, which can be used for further analysis and documentation.   </any other information...> </summary>",
